# 🧬 Ovarian Cancer Classification Using Gene Expression Data

This project applies machine learning to classify ovarian cancer using gene expression profiles. Models include Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and SVM, evaluated using accuracy, ROC-AUC, and gene feature importance.

## 📂 Files Included
- `Ovarian_Cancer_Upgraded_Classification.ipynb` – Full ML pipeline notebook (Google Colab)
- `realistic_ovarian_gene_expression.csv` – Cleaned dataset (100 genes, 60 samples)
- `Ovarian_Cancer_ML_Combined_Report.docx` – Full project + notebook explanation

## 🔍 Results
- Achieved 75% accuracy on real-world structured dataset
- Visualized top predictive genes with feature importance (GENE40, GENE10)
- Evaluated with ROC-AUC and confusion matrix

## 🧠 Tech Stack
Python, scikit-learn, pandas, seaborn, Google Colab
